<dt align="center"><b>History</b></dt>
<dd>History is an intellectual discipline practiced by historians who try to make sense of the past. Because history is about change, nothing was ever “always” a certain way. Non-historians often romanticize the past and speak of the “good old days” when they believe that things were generally better than at present.</dd>
